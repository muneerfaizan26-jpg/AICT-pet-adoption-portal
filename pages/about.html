    <h2>Why Pet Adoption Matters</h2>
    <p>Millions of healthy, loving animals enter shelters every year, waiting for a second chance. Adopting saves lives, fights puppy mills, and brings immense joy. Adopted pets often show incredible gratitude and form deep bonds with their new families.</p>
    <p>Fun Fact: Pets can reduce stress, lower blood pressure, and improve mental health!</p>

  <section class="inspiration">
    <h2>Our Inspiration</h2>
    <p>This project was born from our love for animals and a desire to use our web development skills for good. As students, we wanted to address a real-world issue — pet homelessness — while learning HTML, CSS, and project collaboration.</p>
<p>We drew inspiration from real animal shelters and adoption events, where volunteers work tirelessly to care for pets.</p>
