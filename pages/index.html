<p class="description">
 Every year, thousands of loving animals are abandoned or born on the streets. Our portal is dedicated to connecting these beautiful souls with caring families like yours. 
Whether you're looking for a playful puppy, a cuddly kitten, a gentle rabbit, or a talkative parrot, we have the perfect companion waiting for you.
</p>
<p class="description">
 Launched as a university project, we combine technology and compassion to make adoption easy, transparent, and meaningful. Join us in making a difference — one paw at a time!
