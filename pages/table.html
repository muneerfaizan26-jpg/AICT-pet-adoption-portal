<h1>Adoption Processing Fees</h1>
<p class="intro-text">
Our adoption fees are not a purchase price — they help cover essential care costs such as vaccinations, deworming, spaying/neutering, microchipping, and basic health checks. 
By adopting, you’re supporting our mission to rescue and rehome animals responsibly.
